A co-worker recently turned me on to William Gibson's 1986 [Neuromancer](http://www.amazon.com/Neuromancer-William-Gibson/dp/0441569595), a Sci-Fi novel that ended up having quite the influence on the genre as a whole.

The beginning of the book (and much of the middle) was a little confusing to me at times, as Gibson would drop technical expressions like we already knew what they were. Even if he quite clearly made them up. So I was left wondering just what the heck he was talking about. Somethings would get explained later, but most were not - even the important details. Perhaps if I had read his earlier works, things would have been much clearer. I'm not a big enough fan of his writing style to go investigate though.

The plot of the story centers around a junkie/hacker who is employed by a mysterious individual to bring about the destruction of a certain corporation's servers. In the end we discover that it is all orchestrated by an Artificial Intelligence - living within those servers. The main character releases the AI into the world, and at various points in _the matrix_, the AI even presents itself as a human. Still far fetched by today's standards, right?

The book does introduce some interesting concepts though. Things such as plugging directly into _The Matrix_, or _cyberspace_. And even the ability to be connected wireless-ly to the network. While we haven't quite reached the same virtual world as described in the book, mobile devices certainly keep us attached. 

I couldn't help visualizing parts of the films _The Matrix_, _Hackers_, and _Johnny Mnemonic_ while reading this book. Turns out, Gibson was the author of _Johnny Mnemonic_ as well! I'd recommend this book just to see the origin of some of the details that influenced Sci-Fi in the years after it was released.

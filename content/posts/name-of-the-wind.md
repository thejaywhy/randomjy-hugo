[The Name of the Wind](http://www.amazon.com/The-Name-Wind-Kingkiller-Chronicle/dp/0756404746) by Patrick Rothfuss is the first of a 3 part fantasy series. The book is the "Day One" telling of a three day story by the books main character.

This book in the series is very much an "origin story" about how the main character, Kvothe, grew up and came to be famous. We get glimpses of the glory this young man is destined for, but we're never introduced specifically to what makes him worth of a 3 day story telling binge. Kvothe evidently grows up to be one of the world's most famous magicians, but we don't get quite that far in the first book.

The story was slow going for me in the first few chapters, as I wasn't sure what we were building to. However, once the Kvothe starts telling his story in his words, the pace picks up quite a bit and things get interesting.

The story reminds me a bit of another young lad with a predisposition to magic, Harry Potter. Both are orphans that suffer much through their childhoods, and both prove to be vary proficient with magic and a school that teaches just that!

However, Kvothe is not just a magician, the school he attends actually teaches him how to survive in the real world, such as acting as a doctor, or a craftsman. Magic in this part of the story is relegated mostly to _Sympathy_, willing the mind to control things. This of course if an over simplification of everything, and perhaps I'll get better after finishing the serious.

The title of the book refers to some _true_ magic that Kvothe manifests out of anger. I think the next book might deal with how he comes to actually have control of that ability. The "Name of the Wind" is just one of many "Names" in the world - as all things have "Names" that can be called.

Once I got going on this book, I couldn't put it down. It was well written, and the character development is phenomenal for the main character, but most other characters are given less time. I guess this makes sense - the main character is the one telling the story, and we all love to talk about ourselves.

+++

Imagine that the author of web comic [XKCD](http://xkcd.com/) wrote a book. Now stop imagining - it's real. Randall Munroe wrote [What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions](http://www.amazon.com/What-If-Scientific-Hypothetical-Questions/dp/0544272994) and it's.... interesting.

The book examines various scenarios that writers have submitted in various ways. Many questions are just too "special" to deal with, but others get a thorough examination.

What I learned from reading this book is: we're all going to die. The earth is going to explode - there's no way around it. Almost every question arrives at this conclusion. I'm not sure if that says more about the author, or the person asking these hypothetical questions. 

If you're into _really_ detailed explanations, and educated guesses, this book is for YOU!. I highly recommend the audio book version of this - read by everyone's favorite TNG hero, Wil Wheaton!

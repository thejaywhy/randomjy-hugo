The second book from Jim Gaffigan is called, [Food A Love Story](http://jimgaffigan.com/books/food-a-love-story/) - it's a great read if you want to be constantly hungry.

The book is a tour of American cuisine through Gaffigan's eyes. He breaks the country up into various regions based on the type of food it is known for. Other parts of the world are occasionally thrown in. This is of course all based on his comedy touring.

I learned two things from this book: I should eat more hot dogs, and mustard is pretty great. The book inspired me to eat more hot dogs - with more mustard. I started with just the plain yellow mustard, but quickly progressed to Dijon, and then on to more exotic mustard types.

It was also fun to hear a bit of back story / commentary on Gaffigan's Hot Pocket bit. Kind of like a "Behind the Music" - but about food.

Over the summer, the "Jim Gaffigan Show" started airing on TV Land / Comedy Central. If you've read his books, or heard his comedy, you'll know most of the jokes in the show. Still, I've enjoyed watching it, and trying to get my wife to enjoy it as well.

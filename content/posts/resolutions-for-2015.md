Now that it is February, time to make some goals for myself in 2015. <!--more-->

## Be an even awesomer Husband & Father
I like to think I'm doing a pretty decent job at this already, but there's always room for improvement. And our family will be expanding from 3 to 4 in 2015!

## Make a blog... and keep writing for it
Well, you're here, so I'm doing pretty well so far. Of course, we'll see if I can keep going. 

I've written what I've got so far using [Hugo] (http://gohugo.io). It's a pretty sweet static site generator written in [Go] (http://golang.org/). I like that I can write everything in markdown. After using github for a couple of years, I have problems writing in anything other than Markdown.

## Read 2 Books a Month
Last year I averaged maybe 1 book a month. I read mostly fiction in 2014. In 2015 I'm looking to read both fiction and non-fiction. Ideally one of each type every month. Not sure how the other goals will affect this one. I plan to make time to read in the mornings, after I wake up. Hopefully the house will still be quiet at that point.

## Re-Implement this blog
This is definitely a stretch goal, but I'd like to try re-implementing this blog using various frameworks:

1. rails (no experience)
1. django (some experience from work stuff)
1. elixir (no experience)
1. go & its magnificent stdlib (some experience)

Ideally, I'll write the blog apps to intake the same markdown used by Hugo. And then take advantage of various CI/CD pipelines to deploy new posts too all the apps at the same time.

Then the log term plan becomes use DNS tricks to randomly send users to a different destination. They'll only know what type of framework they are seeing by a "bug" in the footer. Sounds neat, right?

One of my goals for 2015 is to read 2 books a month.  I made this goal towards the end of the January, so I'm pretty pleased to say I got one book done in January, and _two_ in the first seven days of February. Now I just need to finish another one to get my average back on track. I've been getting copies of these books from my local library. The great thing about my library is that it is a part of a system of libraries that make it easy to borrow books from any library in the area. It really expands the number of books I have at my disposal.

### Rework & Remote
In January I read [Rework] (https://37signals.com/rework), and followed it up with [Remote] (https://37signals.com/remote), both by the founders of [37signals] (https://37signals.com) Both of these books are a pretty easy read, a collection of short essays more than anything. Also each essay comes with a nifty illustration. My favorite line from either book is 

> "A stuffed backlog is a stale backlog"

This really hit home for me as a Scrum Master. Our backlog is packed with stuff that we'll get to "some day". Using your backlog for a place to capture ideas is doing it wrong. 

I wouldn't say there's anything revolutionary about either of these books, but they are a both a solid, quick read, worth your time if you work in the Tech Industry. It looks like they have a third book, [Getting Real] (http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Real-Smarter-Successful-Application/dp/0578012812/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1423358012&sr=8-1&keywords=getting+real+37+signals) that I'll probably check out.
 

### How to Win Friends & Influence People
The other book I finished in February was [How to Win Friends & Influence People] (https://www.amazon.com/How-Friends-Influence-People-Revised/dp/067142517X/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1423357609&sr=1-5&keywords=how+to+win+friends+and+influence+people). I find this book on lots of people's "must read" lists. And I can understand why: the book is good at teaching you things you should just know. The book teaches through many, many anecdotes that lead to a single principle for each chapter.

I found this book helpful in changing how I communicate with others. I've always thought of myself as someone who lives by the Golden Rule:

> "Do unto others as you would have done unto yourself."

But the problem is, how I like to be treated is irrelevant when talking with other people. I like my conversations to be short and to the point, and let logic prevail. That's not really what communication is all about for most people. This book has helped me really understand that. I'll probably need to re-read this one every few months to keep myself from sliding back to my very direct conversational style.

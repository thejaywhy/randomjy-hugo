I recently finished reading Jim Gaffigan's [Dad is Fat] (http://www.amazon.com/Dad-Fat-Jim-Gaffigan/dp/0385349076/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1425148385&sr=1-1&keywords=dad+is+fat). It was a great read, I definitely laughed out loud every chapter. My wife was not amused. Reading this book put me back on track for my 2015 goal of 2 books a month. <!--more-->
 

The book is basically a collection of essays about how Gaffigan came to have a family with 5 children, living in a 2 bedroom apartment in NYC. That's crazy, I only have 1 kid (so far) and that's more than enough work. 5 kids? Working nights doing stand up? When does he sleep? He admits to not really ever sleeping. Still impressive.

A general theme throughout the book is Gaffigan's wife, Jeannie, and how she makes everything work (even his stand up). He even correctly refers to himself as just another one of the kids. I know my wife often thinks _"I have two children, but at least I only have to change diapers for the_ actual _kid."_ I'm in no hurry to grow up, especially when I'm spending time with kids. 

My favorite chapter of the book is where Gaffigan compares the role of the Dad to that of Vice President. A figurehead, with no real power. I often feel this way, my kid will _always_ go for Mom. I really am just someone to play with. But I wonder if that's because I spend so much time at work, instead of in the house? Gaffigan seems to spend a lot of time with his kids, but he's still just VP.

If you've got kids, and free time, you should definitely checkout _Dad is Fat_. You'll find a lot of stuff to relate to in there. If you don't have kids, you'll still find laughs, but you may be scared away from having kids for ever. Maybe even skip the whole marriage thing.

I'm looking forward to reading Jim Gaffigan's next book, [Food: A Love Story] (http://www.amazon.com/Food-Love-Story-Jim-Gaffigan/dp/0804140413/ref=pd_sim_b_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=1SGD8NJM1565YNSBCG4R). I will no doubt get a few dirty looks from my wife while I laugh my way through that book too.

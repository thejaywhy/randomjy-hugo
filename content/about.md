### Person

What's up! Who am I? Why am I subjecting you to my random thoughts? Because we're on the Internet, and I can.

First off I'm married with 1 kid already and another on the way. My family is pretty awesome.

I believe in doing as much as I can myself, so I like to build or improve things around our house. Plus, nothing will make you appreciate just how lucky you are more than doing manual labor. I dug dirt in the summers before college, it definitely motivated me to become an Engineer.

In college I studied Computer Engineering & Software Engineering. After I worked in Embedded Systems, mostly coding up DSP type stuff in C. Although there were some deviations, including Java and Ada. Yes, Ada, and I liked it.

Now a days I work at [Dyn] (https//dyn.com) working with [Chef] (https://chef.io), [Python] (https://www.python.org/), and [Varnish] (https://www.varnish-cache.org/). I serve as the Technical Owner & Scrum Master in our Agile/Scrum process. I am thoroughly enjoy working with my Squad as we build out a new SOA based web portal.

I'm always looking to learn new things and improve on what I already know. This blog will hopefully capture that never ending journey.

If you'd like to contact me, [Twitter] (https://twitter.com/random_jyoung) or [LinkedIn] (https://linkedin.com/in/jonryoung/) would be best, Thank you!

### Tech
- I use [vim] (http://www.vim.org) for everything. I have trouble using other editors that don't natively support `h/j/k/l`
- powered by [Hugo] (https://gohugo.io) (and isn't it awesome?)
- Base theme is [Hyde-X] (https://github.com/zyro/hyde-x)
- Further theme inspriation from [npf.io] (http://npf.io/)
